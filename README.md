# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository is designed to provide clear and well-explained implementations of various data structures in Python.

## Folder Structure

- [LinkedList](LinkedList/)
  - [Intro Linked List](LinkedList/linked-list.md)
  - [Example of Linked List](LinkedList/linked-list-example.md)
  - [Advance Linked List](LinkedList/advance-linked-list.md)
  - [Doubly Linked List](LinkedList/doubly-linked-list.md)
  - [Implementation of Linked List](LinkedList/linked-list.py)

## Usage

- **Prerequisites:** You'll need a basic understanding of Python programming. Familiarity with data structures will be beneficial.

- **Getting Started:**

  1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/satishjhanwer/deep-dive-dsa.git
     ```

  2. Navigate to the folder

     ```bash
     cd deep-dive-dsa
     code .
     ```

  3. Open the files in a suitable Python IDE or code editor.
  4. Run the `linked-list.py` file or explore individual operations within it to see the linked list implementation in action.

- **Learning:**
  - Refer to the documentation files (`.md` files) for detailed explanations and examples.
  - Run the Python code and experiment with different functionalities.

## Future Plans

We are actively working on extending this repository to include implementations of additional data structures, such as:

- Arrays
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs

Feel free to check back for updates or contribute your own implementations to make this a comprehensive data structures resource.
